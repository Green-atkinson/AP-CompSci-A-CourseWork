Topic: Demonstrates how to use inheritances with Client program to use the Burger & PubBurger classes


// 4 constructer
// Write a class called Burger, a class called PubBurger that extends it, and a driver class called
// BurgerMain that proves the functionality listed below . Burger must contain boolean fields called
// ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion, mayo, lettuce, tomato and cheese. It must
// also contain an integer field called patties. PubBurgers have two additional fields, both
// Strings, called FancySauce and FancyBun respectively. Tomatoes cost $.25, cheese costs $.50,
// and burgers start at $4.00, with $1 added for each patty after 1, maximum 3. If a burger is a pub burger,
// it should cost $2 more than a burger with exactly the same condiments. Two Burgers are equal if their
// condiments and status as a PubBurger are all the same.
// You must:
// 1. Follow the syntax template for well-encapsulated classes.
// 2. Include the private fields listed above.
// 3. Have constructors that re-implement the default constructor and allow a user to set all fields.
// 4. Implement getPrice(), equals(), and toString()
// 5. Have accessors and mutators for each field.
// 6. Include a driver class called BurgerMain that proves you have completed the work above.
// 7. Save all of your work in a folder called lastName_Burger.
//in equalls, you need to compare 3 burgers
